# SQuARE Skill Helpers
This package facilitates the interaction with UKP-SQuARE APIs. Currently, interacting with the Models and Datastores is supported. This helps when implementing Skills.

## Installation
To install the latest stable version:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/UKP-SQuARE/square-skill-helpers.git@v0.0.8
```
To install from the master branch:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/UKP-SQuARE/square-skill-helpers.git
```

## Usage
After installing, the Datastore and Model API can be called easily. Before running the code, environment variables need to be set.
- `KEYCLOAK_BASE_URL`: The address where tokens can be obtained from. For UKP-SQuARE set this to `https://square.ukp-lab.de`
- `REALM`: The realm in which your Keycloak client resides. For UKP-SQuARE this is `square`.
- `CLIENT_ID`: The ID of your client. For UKP-SQuARE, you will receive this from the UI when creating a new skill.
- `CLIENT_SECRET`: The secret of your client/skill. For UKP-SQuARE, you will receive this from the UI when creating a new skill.

        pipeline="question-answering", 
        model_request=model_request
    )
    print(model_api_output['answers'][0])
    # [{'score': 0.9184646010398865, 'start': 275, 'end': 279, 'answer': '1877'}]
